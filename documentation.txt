I am krish parmar (grc_id:25GRC1034).The task that i assigned was to make free fall calculator.

Task: Develop a program to calculate the time of fall, final velocity, and displacement for an object in free fall from a given height. 
Ensure the program correctly handles the physics of free fall and provides accurate results.

During this task first i studied what is free fall and its other related terminologies and mathematical formulas to it .
So basically free fall is the motion of an object falling solely under the influence of gravity, with no other forces acting on it.
Here influence of gravity is 9.81 m/s2.So I defined value of gravity in my code.And as defined in task that height will be given by user so,we will use scanf function.
As we know that in physics there are already formulas given for values that we have to find.

Formulas ,
   time to fall = squareroot(2*height/gravity)
   final velocity = gravity* time to fall
   displacement = (1.0 / 2.0) * gravity * square(time to fall)

As we can see that there are mathematical functions such as square root and square so,therefore we will use math.h library.
