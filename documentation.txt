I am krish parmar (grc_id:25GRC1034).The task that i assigned was to make free fall calculator.

Task: Develop a program to calculate the time of fall, final velocity, and displacement for an object in free fall from a given height. 
Ensure the program correctly handles the physics of free fall and provides accurate results.

 This library provides a simple interface to calculate the velocity, time, and distance of an object in free fall under the influence of gravity. It allows users to compute these values based on the equations of motion.
The library will consist of a header file (freefall.h) and an implementation file (freefall.c).
Header file contains the function prototypes and constants used by the library.
Implementation file contains the actual implementation of the functions declared in the header file.

After creating .h and .c file of library we can use it in our code by including the header file(#include "free_fall.h") in our program .
This library simplifies free fall calculations by encapsulating the core logic in reusable functions. By creating a clear interface, it can be integrated into any larger project requiring physics-based computations.
